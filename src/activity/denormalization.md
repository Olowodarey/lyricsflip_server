# Activity Data Denormalization Strategy

## Purpose
This document outlines the denormalization strategy for the Activity module to optimize read operations while maintaining data consistency.

## Core Principles
1. Store essential data redundantly to reduce joins
2. Use background processes to maintain data consistency
3. Balance between normalization and denormalization based on access patterns

## Denormalization Decisions

### 1. User Information
- **Normalized Approach**: Store only `userId` in Activity model
- **Denormalization**: Populate user details (name, avatar) during read
- **Rationale**: User data changes infrequently, but populating on every read avoids stale data issues

### 2. Content Information
- **Approach**: Store minimal content context in metadata
- **Denormalized Fields**:
  - `metadata.contentTitle`: Title of content
  - `metadata.contentPreview`: Brief content preview
  - `metadata.contentImage`: Image URL if applicable
- **Rationale**: Reduces need for separate content lookups when displaying activity feeds

### 3. Activity Counts
- **Approach**: Use aggregation queries for counts (likes, comments)
- **Rationale**: Keeping counters in content documents would require complex synchronization
  
### 4. Background Synchronization
- Implement event listeners for user profile updates to sync critical denormalized data
- Schedule periodic jobs to reconcile any data inconsistencies

## Indexing Strategy
- Compound indexes for common access patterns:
  - `{ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 }`: User profile pages
  - `{ contentId: 1, activityType: 1 }`: Content-specific activity (likes, comments)
  - `{ activityType: 1, createdAt: -1 }`: Global activity feeds
  - `{ contentType: 1, contentId: 1, createdAt: -1 }`: Content timelines

## Data Consistency Considerations
- Accept eventual consistency for activity feeds
- Use transactions for critical operations (where available)
- Implement idempotent operations to avoid duplication

## Future Optimizations
- Consider time-based partitioning for large activity collections
- Evaluate caching strategies for high-traffic activity feeds
- Consider read replicas for scaling read-heavy operations
